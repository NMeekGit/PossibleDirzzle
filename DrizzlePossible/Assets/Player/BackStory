Command,
I've had to abandon ship, I don't know where I am, it appears to be a small farm town on an unknown planet.
I can see where my ship has crashed, but it appears the local scrapper has claimed it. He says I can buy it back for $300.
One of the locals has an infestation of robot crawlers, and is willing to pay for those that I exterminate.
In the morning, I'll buy my ship back...
Wish me luck,
Soldier47
